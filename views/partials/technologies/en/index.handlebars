<h4>{{ _ "Whant to know more about our infrastructure?" }}</h4>

<p>So, you are a developer who can't resist the temptation to take a sneak peak in the infrastructure? Don't worry, we understand. ;)</p>
<p>Our platform is based on Red Hat <a href="https://github.com/openshift" target="_blank">Openshift Origin</a> and Amazon AWS infrastructure. The servers are distributed in three different Availability Zones or AZs, providing more reliability. More about <a href="https://getup.zendesk.com/entries/22999758" target="_blank">Getup topology</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank">Amazon AZs model</a>.</p>

<p>To isolate and have more control of our network we use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/" target="_blank">Amazon VPC</a>; <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">Puppet</a> to deploy and setup new server instances more quickly, standardized and predictable way and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" target="_blank">Amazon CloudWatch</a> to monitor the infrastructure health.</p>
