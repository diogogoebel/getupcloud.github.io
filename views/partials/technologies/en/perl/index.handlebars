<p>{{ _ "Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files." }}</p>
